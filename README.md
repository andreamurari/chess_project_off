# This project wants to explore the world of chess using this data set:

The goal of this study is to figure out which opening moves are most frequently used and also those that most frequently lead to a win. In addition, it will be analyzed how much starting first (having the white pieces) affects the game's victory probability and whether this effect, in games with more turns, is less impactful.
